# Algorithm Analyzer Tool

This C++ project provides functions to measure the execution time of sorting and searching algorithms. The `measureSortingTime` and `measureSearchingTime` functions calculate the time taken by a specified algorithm and display its theoretical time complexity. This is useful for comparing different algorithms and understanding their performance on various data sizes. Simply pass any sorting or searching function to these measurement functions to get the runtime in seconds along with the complexity notation. Ideal for learning and analyzing algorithm efficiency!
